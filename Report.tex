\begin{abstract}

With the launch of the lunar orbiter laser altimeter (LOLA) on NASA's lunar reconnaissance orbiter (LRO), a large amount of high-resolution digital elevation maps (DEMs) have been constructed, providing a precise topographical model of the moons surface.
These DEMs are prone to voids containing no data, making the map less reliable for scientific purposes and future moon missions.
This paper uses a machine learning model to allow for the technique of image inpainting to be used with lunar DEMs.
Image inpainting uses pixel data from an image to generate missing data to fill a void.
DEMs can be thought of mathematically as identical to a single channel (greyscale) image, a two-dimensional array with "pixel" values corresponding to height, and so the technique of image inpainting can be easily applied to DEMs.
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based on a fully convolutional architecture was used for the inpainting.

Sensory data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) has been used for the construction of Lunar digital elevation models (DEMs) since its launch upon the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009.
LOLA has several primary objectives as part of a series of robotic missions that aim to pave the way for a permanent human presence on the Moon, including determining the global topography of the lunar surface at meter-scale resolution.
Topographical data from LOLA will be used to facilitate the selection of future landing sites, so accuracy and completeness are essential.
\autocite{chinLunarReconnaissanceOrbiter2007}

The LRO is in a polar orbit around the moon, with LOLA scanning the surface in swathes 50 to 60m wide, with an average separation ranging between 1.2km and 200m depending on the position of LRO in orbit.\autocite{smithLunarOrbiterLaser2010}.
To construct a complete DEM from these swathes they must be combined, requiring blending between swatches (with potential separation), resulting in artefacts and non-accurate data.
LOLA DEMs are also prone to no-data voids in regions where topographical features block reflection of the laser to LOLA, such as deep craters.

Reconstructing no-data voids in Lunar DEMs is non-trivial due to the challenging requirements: 1) high resolution DEMs require high-resolution reconstruction methodology, 2) reconstruction algorithm must be reliable since it can affect related lunar studies or exploration missions, and 3) LOLA DEM is a large and high-resolution area map, thus a scalable approach should be applied.\autocite{parkNeuralProcessApproach2021}.
Accordingly, this paper aims to develop a deep learning approach to robustly and accurately infer no-data voids whilst maintaining the same resolution of the input DEM.
